# Can we talk about reproducibility?


"The reproducibility of data is a measure of whether results in a paper can be attained by a different research team, using the same methods. This shows that the results obtained are not artifacts of the unique setup in one research lab. [1]"

# A gentle introduction to Rstudio

RStudio is an integrated development environment for R, a programming language for statistical computing and graphics. The RStudio IDE is developed by RStudio, Inc., a commercial enterprise founded by JJ Allaire, creator of the programming language ColdFusion.

How to install? Check it [out](www.google.com.br)!

# Panes, Addins and Shortcuts

![:scale 50%](figures/rstudio_ide.png)

**Figure 1. Rstudio panels.** *Source*, coding area similar text editor. *Console*, all code typed into "Source" area will be evaluated into R Console. *Environment/History*, in this panel we can inspect what objects were loaded into your workspace. *Files/Plots/Packages/Help*, another useful panel, allowing directory browsing, plot visualization, package installation or selection.

# Organizing myself with Rprojects!

**RStudio** projects make it straightforward to divide your work into multiple contexts, each with their own working directory, workspace, history, and source documents.

But what it means? In short, productivity and **less headache**

---
The .RProj in a nutshell!

1. Creates a project file (with an .Rproj extension) within the project directory. This file contains various project options (discussed below) and can also be used as a shortcut for opening the project directly from the filesystem.

2. Creates a hidden directory (named .Rproj.user) where project-specific temporary files (e.g. auto-saved source documents, window-state, etc.) are stored. This directory is also automatically added to .Rbuildignore, .gitignore, etc. if required.

3. Loads the project into RStudio and display its name in the Projects toolbar (which is located on the far right side of the main toolbar)

[Oficial Documentation](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects)

## For your convenience

1. Click the **File** menu button, then **New Project**.
2. Click **New Directory**.
3. Click **New Project**.
4. Type in the name of the directory to store your project, e.g. **my_project**.
5. If available, select the checkbox for **Create a git repository.**
6. Click the **Create Project** button.

(WAIT! We gonna have a hands-on moment)

# Welcome to RMarkdown 

Basically, it is an authoring framework for data science developed by RStudio Team. RMarkdown is an R package build upon **Markdown** is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Originally Markdown was written in **Perl**,  allowing you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

### Almost in the hands-on moment! But first, a few concepts in RMarkdown!

[RMarkdown concepts]

---
# Hands-on moment...

1. Click the *File* menu button, then *New File*.
2. Click *R Markdown*.
3. Type the title *My R Mardown*.
4. Type the author name *It is me, Mario*.
5. Click *HTML* as default output format.
6. Finally, click the *OK* button.

## A few basic command in Git that you should know...

- init
- clone
- remote
--

- status
- add
- commit
- push

--
- pull
- merge

#### We are not covering git commands in this class, but I strongly suggest you guys understand more about the program. Please check out this outstanding [tutorial](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

4. Type in the name of the directory to store your project, e.g. **my_project**.
5. If available, select the checkbox for **Create a git repository.**
6. Click the **Create Project** button.

# Is this all? Of course...

#### *But no*

### More about good pratices

- You may should take a look in *Lintr*
- Or Tidyverse coding style
- Project organization

---
# A few extras :)

### To study

- Bookdown and Blogdown
- Shiny Apps
- Rticles package
- **R presentations**
